# Liri Project

This project uses two API's; the Spotify API, and the OMDB API. In order to do a music search, simply type in process.argv "spotify-this" followed by a space and your keywords. The same logic applies for a movie search, except you will replace "spotify-this" with omdb-this". 

However, this application is still not fully functional. I will need to come into office hours to figure out the correct process, but I think I am close.
